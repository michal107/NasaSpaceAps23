The website is an offer of interplanetary travel agency focusing on creating a tool that will not only develop customized itineraries for future travellers who want to visit the main bodies in our solar system—perhaps Mars, Jupiter, or Saturn—but also educate present-day users about the many different objects in our solar system.
