# NasaSpaceAps23

Source code of web application written by Zofia Stypułkowska, Michał Ślimak and Jakub Oprychał in collaboration with Anna Sobala and Michał Wnuk.

The website is an offer of interplanetary travel agency focusing on creating a tool that will not only develop customized itineraries for future travellers who want to visit the main bodies in our solar system—perhaps Mars, Jupiter, or Saturn—but also educate present-day users about the many different objects in our solar system. 

We created a service that promotes informed travel choices for everyone. Our expeditions will not only be entertaining, but also informative and educational. Our mission is to foster love and admiration towards our neighbouring planets, their breathtaking landscapes and unique environments

To run the website run the command python app.py in Code folder and enter the IP address.

The project is divided into sections responsible for frontend, style and backend along with the database (for this moment it's not used as we weren't able to complete the entire project). In the folder Code/static you will find all of our graphics and css style files. In Code/templates, we store all of our frontend files such as HTML or JS code. The main file is placed directly in Code folder, written in Python using Flask framework controls all of our backend and traffic handled by the website.
