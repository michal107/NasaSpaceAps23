                    <p class="summary">All our tours start from the 'New Horizons' station, which can be reached either by space elevator or by ship. The anchor point of the elevator is in Stalowa Wola, Poland, its exact departure times can be checked on the website www.spaceelevatorpoland.com. The lift journey takes four days. There is a second faster but definitely more expensive option, the spaceship, which takes about 8 hours to travel. Timetables and departure locations can be checked at www.spacetaxinewhorizon.com.</p>

                    <h1>SPACECRAFT</h1>
                    <p class="summary">We travel between sites in our private space vehicle. It accommodates 50 passengers including a large amount of luggage. There are 2 modules available for passengers, both consisting of 30 double or single cabins. In addition, the ship has an astronomical observatory, a gym, two restaurants (one in each module), and relaxation rooms with VR technology. During the flight, there is a force action almost all the time, which allows you to feel like you are on Earth and offsets the consequences associated with the lack of attraction. To this end, the ship consists of two modules a cylindrical module 1 and a rotating module 2. Module 1 is used during the journey when our ship is accelerating. At the moment of braking or stopping, module 2 is used which, by rotating, provides the acceleration that maintains the feeling of gravity..</p>
